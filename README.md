## How It Works
1. Type the name of a Donut you want to eat.
2. Click the `Add to Mnch` button next to send the donut to your `Must Munch List`.
3. Now that the donut has entered your belly you'll see it in your `Munched Already,...` list.
4. Feel free to keep track of the donuts you want to eat and the ones you already have.
